# RandomNameGenerator
A little exercise in Java, following the concepts of "Clean Code" (Robert C. Martin)

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to generate a name, based on the gender and the number of fore- and surnames.

Initially that was all about this project to say, until I chose to offer different user interfaces.
At the time writing, the implementations for a console interface, as well as one for a swing interface are done.
I am planning to learn a little bit about JavaFX and implement an interface using that as well.

All these steps under the premise to stick to the lessons learned from Robert C. Martins "Clean Code".

## Usage
When compiled, run with the following arguments:  
`console` - Console interface (Question â†’ Answer Style)  
`swing`   - Swing interface  
`fx`      - JavaFX interface (not yet implemented)  
everything else defaults to the console interface.
